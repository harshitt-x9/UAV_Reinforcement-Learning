### Description
This repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of DDPG-based UAV deployment in static environments, used for simulations in various journal and conference publications by these authors. [IEEE Internet of Things Journal, EuCNC 2024].

This repository contains code and configurations for training the UAV agents for this environment. This Repository will be soon updated with the dynamic environment.
